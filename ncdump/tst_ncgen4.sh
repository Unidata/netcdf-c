# To add a new test,
# 1. put the .cdl file in the 'cdl4' directory
# 2. put the result of running ncgen then ncdump
#    into the directory 'expected4' as .dmp
# 3. Modify the file tst_ncgen_shared.sh to add
#    the test to the end of the TESTS4 variable
# 4. Add the new files into cdl4/Makefile.am
#    and expected4/Makefile.am
