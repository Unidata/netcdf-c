/*
This hashmap is optimized to assume null-terminated strings as the
key.

Data is presumed to be an index into some other table Assume it
can be compared using simple == The key is some hash of some
null terminated string.

One problem here is that we need to do a final equality check on
the name string to avoid an accidental hash collision. It would
be nice if we had a large enough hashkey that was known to have
an extremely low probability of collisions so we could compare
the hashkeys to determine exact match. A quick internet search
indicates that this is rather more tricky than just using
e.g. crc64 or such.  Needs some thought.
