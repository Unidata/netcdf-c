    <h1>Where is NetCDF Used?</h1>
    <p>
      Making the software available freely available without registration
      makes it difficult
      to know where and how netCDF is being used, but we have compiled a

        The Computer Planning Committee of NOAA&#39;s Pacific Marine Environmental
        Laboratory (PMEL) endorsed netCDF as the preferred data format for the Laboratory
        in early 1993. PMEL has developed two freely-distributed applications that
        utilize NetCDF -- the EPIC system (for observational data) and Ferret (gridded
        data).
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic">EPIC</a> is a system for management,
          display and analysis of oceanographic time series and hydrographic data.
          EPIC toolkits for netCDF include a data file I/O library, which is layered
          on top of the netCDF library, a netCDF calculator (nccalc) linked with a
          scientific graphics package (PPLUS), a suite of display and analysis programs
          for oceanographic data, and a <a
          href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/mexeps.html">MATLAB interface</a> to netCDF.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ferret/home.html">Ferret</a> is a visualization
          and analysis program, also built upon the PPLUS program, that permits users
          to explore large and complex gridded data sets. New variables may be defined
          interactively as mathematical transformations. Complex analyses proceed
          as hierarchical variable definitions. Visit <a

        <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/">Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a>
        of Columbia University has converted all Marine Geophysics data (gravity,
        magnetics and bathymetry) acquired in the past 40 years by scientists at L-DEO
        as well as at other institutions to netCDF. The <a

        being cooperatively pursued by the EPA&#39;s Atmospheric Research Laboratory
        and by North Carolina Supercomputing Center, is using an environmental-modeling-specific
        applications programming interface on top of UCAR&#39;s netCDF as the means
        for persistent storage of both observational and model-output data, as well
        as for storing sets of data-file-structure definitions and (prototype, so

        A group in the Atmospheric Chemistry Division at NCAR (the National Center

        Satellite) data uses netCDF for their binary data format. Output from NCAR&#39;s
        High Altitude Observatory Division Thermospheric General Circulation Model
        (TGCM) and related models are converted to netCDF files for post-model visualization
        and diagnostic codes. NCAR&#39;s Research Aviation Facility has decided to

        Quick look data from various projects is distributed by RDP in netCDF. NetCDF

        The Cooperative Program for Operation Meteorology, Education, and Training
        (COMET), a program of UCAR, has created an extensive archive of meteorological
        case studies that contain observed and gridded data in netCDF. The netCDF
        definition in use was created by the Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL), a
        NOAA agency, and files in this format are required for capatability with their
        PC-DARE workstations which are used in the COMET teaching classroom. COMET
        plans to create future case studies using the netCDF conventions currently
        being developed by a working group of Unidata, COMET, and FSL personnel.

          access system that will be employed at all of the NOAA RCCs and will be
          linked to the NOAA Virtual Data System (NVDS).

        A major component of the US Climate and Global Change program is the TOGA-TAO
        Array in the tropical Pacific, which proposes to maintain approximately 70
        moored ATLAS wind and thermistor chain and current meter buoys, spanning the
        Pacific ocean from 95W to 137E in the equatorial wave guide. The TAO Project
        Office, at PMEL, has developed distribution and display software for the real-time
        data from the TAO buoys, in a point-and-click UNIX workstation environment.
        This software is distributed nationally and internationally. All data is stored
        and distributed in netCDF format. All graphics displays and animations are
        produced with the EPIC tools for working with netCDF data files.

        At the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, netCDF is used in several areas.
        Ships in the UNOLS fleet are recording measurements from the IMET systems
        in netCDF form. These data include wind, barometer, humidity, air and sea
        temperature, precipitation, short wave radiation, and GPS navigation. Data
        sets from these systems taken during the WOCE experiments in the Pacific have
        been archived recently at NCAR. Also, measurements from a diverse set of instruments
        deployed on buoys for the Subduction, TOGA/COARE, and several other experiments
        are translated into netCDF form for processing and archival. Reports that
        describe the software systems used for these processing activities are available
        from WHOI.

        Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and the University Corporation

        NetCDF is the vehicle adopted by the Analytical Instrument Association [AIA]
        to implement the Analytical Data Interchange Protocols [Andi Protocols] for
        chromatography [released in 1992] and mass spectrometry [released in 1994].
        The Andi
        Protocols increase laboratory efficiency and productivity
        by facilitating the integration and use of data from multiple vendors&#39;
        products. For more information about the Andi chromatography protocols, see

        Further development related to these standards now seems to be under the purview of
        an ASTM subcommittee E13.15 on analytical Data Management, at the
        Source Forge site <a href="http://andi.sourceforge.net/"

        The Positron Imaging Laboratories and the Neuro-Imaging Laboratory of the
        Montreal Neurological Institute have selected netCDF as the data format for
        their medical image files. Conventions for variable and attribute names and
        values have been established for the medical imaging context. These conventions,
        along with a package of routines to assist in handling image data, make up
        the MINC (Medical Image NetCDF) format. For more information, contact Peter
        Neelin (neelin@pet.mni.mcgill.ca) or see <a href="http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/minc/" > http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/minc/</a>. <p></p>

        In computational biology, specifically flow cytometry, netCDF/HDF5
        format has been used in new OpenCyto software. See

        Automated, End-to-End Flow Cytometry Data Analysis. PLoS Comput Biol 10(8): e1003806. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003806.

        At the Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (<a href="http://www.baw.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">BAW</a>),
        netCDF is used in several ways. In combination with the <a href="https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions">UGRID conventions</a>
        computational results from different hydrodynamic numerical models are stored for unstructured grids,
        e.g. water level, current velocity, and salinity. NetCDF is also used to store derived quantities
        like tidal high and low water, tidal range and many other similar characteristic numbers. In addition,
        measured data (tide gauge data, ADCP) are also stored in netCDF files based on NOAA's
        <a href="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/data/formats/netcdf/v1.1/">NODC NetCDF templates</a>.<p></p>
