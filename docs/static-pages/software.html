    <h1>Software for Manipulating or Displaying NetCDF Data</h1>
    <p>
      This document provides references to software packages that may be used for manipulating
      or displaying <a
      href="/software/netcdf/">netCDF</a> data. We include information about
      both freely-available and licensed (commercial) software that can be used with
      netCDF data. We rely on developers to help keep this list up-to-date. If you know
      of corrections or additions, please <a href="mailto:support@unidata.ucar.edu">send
      them to us</a>. Where practical, we would like to include WWW links to information
      about these packages in the HTML version of this document.

      The ARM Program has developed
      <a href="http://engineering.arm.gov/~sbeus/andx-web/html/" >ANDX (ARM
      NetCDF Data eXtract)</a>,
      a command-line utility designed for routine examination and
      extraction of data from netcdf files. Data can be displayed
      graphically (line-plot, scatter-plot, overlay, color-intensity, etc.)
      or extracted as ASCII data. Whether displayed graphically or extracted
      as ASCII, results can be saved to disk or viewed on screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://science.arm.gov/~cflynn/ARM_Tested_Tools/" >ANAX (ARM
      NetCDF ASCII eXtract)</a> is a scaled-down version of ANDX -- it is
      designed to only extract ASCII data. All features of ANDX pertaining
      to non-graphic data extraction are included in ANAX.
    </p>

    <h2><a id="ANTS" name="ANTS">ANTS</a></h2>
    <p>
      The ARM Program has developed <a
      href="http://science.arm.gov/~cflynn/ANTS/" >ANTS (ARM NetCDF Tool
      Suite)</a>, a collection of netCDF tools and utilities providing
      various means of creating and modifying netcdf files. ANTS is based on
      nctools written by Chuck Denham. The utilities within nctools were
      modified to compile with version 3.5 of the netCDF library, the
      command syntax was modified for consistency with other tools, and
      changes were made to accommodate ARM standard netCDF.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original functions from nctools were intended mainly for the
      creation, definition, and copying of fundamental netCDF elements. ARM
      added others which focus on manipulation of data within existing
      netCDF files. Additional functions have special support for
      multi-dimensional data such as "slicing" cross sections from
      multi-dimensional variable data or joining lesser-dimensional fields
      to form multi-dimensional structures. Functions have been added to
      support execution of arithmetic and logical operations, bundling or
      splitting netCDF files, comparing the structure or content of files,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Essentially every type of netCDF library function call is
      exercised in ANTS. In this way then, this open-source collection of
      tools also represents a library of coding examples for fundamental
      netCDF tasks.  See the <a href="http://science.arm.gov/~cflynn/ANTS/"
      >website</a> for more information.

      <a href="http://www.lapeth.ethz.ch/argos/index.html">ARGOS</a> (interActive thRee-dimensional

      of Technology, ETH, ZÃ¼rich.
    </p>

    <p>
      A highly optimized graphical user interface allows quick and elegant creation
      of even complex 3D graphics (volume rendering, isosurfaces,...), including Z-buffered
      overlays (with hidden lines), light and data shading, Xray images, 3D trajectories,
      animations and virtual flights around your data, all documented in a full on-line
      <a
      href="http://www.lapeth.ethz.ch/argos/argos_general.html">html-help</a>. The netCDF
      data format is preferred, but any other format can be read by providing an IDL
      (or FORTRAN or C or C++) interface. Some toolboxes (for atmospheric model output,
      trajectory display, radar data) have already been written, others might easily
      be added (in IDL, FORTRAN or C code). All interactive activities are tracked
      in a script, allowing quick reconstruction of anything done as well as running
      ARGOS in batch script mode.

    <h2><a id="CDAT" name="CDAT">CDAT</a></h2>
    The <a href="http://cdat.sf.net">Climate Data Analysis Tool
    (CDAT)</a>, developed by the <a
    href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/">Program for Climate Model Diagnosis
    and Intercomparison (PCMDI)</a> at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, provides
    the capabilities needed to analyze model data, perform complex mathematical calculations,
    and graphically display the results. It provides the necessary tools to diagnose,
    validate, and intercompare large observational and global climate model data sets.
    <p>
      It includes the ability to ingest
      large climate datasets in netCDF, HDF, DRS, and GrADS/GRIB format;
      the Visualization and Computation System (VCS) module, visually displays and
      animates ingested or created data; and the Library of AMIP Data Transmission
      Standards (LATS) module outputs data in the machine-independent netCDF or GrADS/GRIB
      file formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the Command Line Interface (CLI) module allows
      CDAT to receive argument and function input via the command line, and the Graphical
      User Interface (GUI) allows CDAT to receive argument and function input via
      a point-and-click environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The software, which runs as a standalone process or within PCMDI&#39;s
      Visualization and Computation System (VCS), provides climate scientists with
      an easy and fast method to read different file formats, and to analyze and
      graphically display climate data in an integrated fashion. CDAT includes a
      set of pre-defined functions to allow the user to manipulate the data and
      send the output to a file which can be viewed as an image, or as a collection
      of images in an animation. The software has a gradual learning curve, allowing
      the novice user to quickly obtain useful results.

    <p>
      Joe Sirott of NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory has
      developed cdfsync, a program that allows users to rapidly synchronize a
      set of netCDF files over a network. Fast synchronization times are
      achieved by only transmitting the differences between files. It is
      built on the Open Source <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/" >rsync</a>
      program, but contains a number of optimizations including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Special handling of netCDF files for faster synchronization
          calculations
        </li>
        <li>
          Much faster updates of large numbers of small netCDF files
        </li>
        <li>
          In-place updates of large netCDF files

    <p>
      The CSIRO MATLAB/netCDF interface is run from within MATLAB and has a simple

    </p>
    <p>
      The basis of the interface is a machine-dependent mex-file called
      mexcdf53. Rather than call the mex-file
      directly users are advised to employ both <a href="#NC4ML5">Chuck Denham&#39;s

      read-only access to existing netCDF data, the CSIRO interface has a simpler

    <p>
      FERRET offers a Mathematica-like approach to analysis; new variables may be
      defined interactively as mathematical expressions involving data set variables.
      Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully documented
      graphics are produced with a single command. Graphics styles included line plots,
      scatter plots, contour plots, color-filled contour plots, vector plots, wire
      frame plots, etc. Detailed controls over plot characteristics, page layout and
      overlays are provided. NetCDF is supported both as an input and an output format.

    <h2><a id="HDF interface" name="HDF interface">HDF interface</a></h2>
    The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) has added the netCDF
    interface to their <a
    href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)</a> software.
    HDF is an extensible data format for self-describing files. A substantial set
    of applications and utilities based on HDF is available; these support raster-image
    manipulation and display and browsing through multidimensional scientific data.
    An implementation is now available that provides the netCDF interface to HDF.
    With this software, it is possible to use the netCDF calling interface to place
    data into an HDF file. The netCDF calling interface has not changed and netCDF
    files stored in XDR format are readable, so existing programs and data will still
    be usable (although programs will need to be relinked to the new library). There
    is currently no support for the mixing of HDF and netCDF structures. For example,
    a raster image can exist in the same file as a netCDF object, but you have to
    use the Raster Image interface to read the image and the netCDF interface to read
    the netCDF object. The other HDF interfaces are currently being modified to allow
    multi-file access, closer integration with the netCDF interface will probably
    be delayed until the end of that project.
    <p>
      Eventually, it will be possible to integrate netCDF objects with the rest of
      the HDF tool suite. Such an integration will then allow tools written for netCDF
      and tools written for HDF to both interact intelligently with the new data files.

    <blockquote>
      The Data Catalog is both a catalog and a library of datasets, i.e.
      it both helps you figure out which data you want, and helps you work with the
      data. The interface allows you to make plots, tables, and files from any dataset,
      its subsets, or processed versions thereof.
      <p>
        This data server is designed to make data accessible to people using WWW
        clients (viewers) and to serve as a data resource for WWW documents. Since
        most documents cannot use raw data, the server is able to deliver the data
        in a variety of ways: as data files (netCDF and HDF), as tables (html), and
        in a variety of plots (line, contour, color, vector) and plot formats (PostScript
        and gif). Processing of the data, particularly averaging, can be requested
        as well.

    <h2><a id="IVE" name="IVE">IVE</a></h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.atmos.washington.edu/ive/">IVE (Interactive Visualization
      Environment)</a> is a software package designed to interactively display and analyze
      gridded data. IVE assumes the data to be displayed are contained in one- two-,
      three- or four-dimensional arrays. By default, the numbers within these arrays
      are assumed to represent grid point values of some field variable (such as pressure)
      on a rectangular evenly spaced grid. IVE is, nevertheless, capable of displaying
      data on arbitrary curvilinear grids.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the data points are not evenly spaced on a rectangular grid, IVE must be
      informed of the grid structure, either by specifying &quot;attributes&quot;
      in the data input or by specifying the coordinate transform in a user supplied
      subroutine. Stretched rectangular grids (which occur when the stretching along
      a given coordinate is a function only of the value of that coordinate) can be
      accommodated by specifying one-dimensional arrays containing the grid-point
      locations along the stretched coordinate as part of the IVE input data. Staggered
      meshes can also be accommodated by setting &quot;attributes&quot; in the input
      data. The structure of more complicated curvilinear grids must be communicated
      to IVE via user supplied &quot;transforms,&quot; which define the mapping between
      physical space and the array indices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since four-dimensional data cannot be directly displayed on a flat computer
      screen, it is necessary to reduced the dimensionality of the data before it
      is displayed. One of IVE&#39;s primary capabilities involves dimension reduction
      or &quot;data slicing.&quot; IVE allows the user to display lower-dimensional
      subsets of the data by fixing a coordinate or by averaging over the coordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVE currently has the capability to display
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        scalar fields as
        <ul>
          <li>
            2D scalar plots

      </li>
      <li>
        vector fields as 2D vector plots
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      IVE lets you overlay plots, loop plots, and control a wide variety of display
      parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVE also can perform algebraic computations on the gridded data and can calculate
      derivatives. More complicated computations can be performed in user supplied
      subroutines.
    </p>
    <p>
      IVE uses NetCDF for the data input format, and uses the <a

      integrated multidisciplinary analysis of multibody, multiphysics
      systems, including nonlinear mechanics of rigid and flexible
      constrained bodies, smart materials, electric networks, active
      control, hydraulic networks, essential fixed-wing and rotorcraft
      aerodynamics.  It allows users to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous
      mechanical, aero-servo-elastic systems based on first principles
      equations.  It is being actively developed and used in the aerospace
      and automotive fields for dynamics analysis and simulation of complex
      systems.  Dynamic linking of
      user-defined modules is heavily exploited to let users extend the

      This is a program which compares two NetCDF files. Variables with the
      same ID in the two files are assumed to be of the same type and have
      the same shape.  For each such couple of variables, the program
      computes the maximum of the absolute value of the difference, and the
      maximum of the absolute value of the relative difference. The program
      also tells you at what location (the subscript list of the array) the
      maximum difference is reached.

      Joaquim Luis of Universidade do Algarve has developed <a href="http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/mirone/">Mirone</a>,
      a Windows MATLAB-based framework tool that
      allows the display and manipulation of a large number of grid/images
      formats through its interface with the <a
      href="http://remotesensing.org/gdal/" >GDAL</a> library. Its main
      purpose is to provide users with an easy-to-use graphical interface to
      manipulate <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/" >GMT</a> grids. In
      addition it offers a wide range of tools
      dedicated to topics in the earth sciences, including tools for
      multibeam mission planning, elastic deformation studies, tsunami
      propagation modeling, earth magnetic field computations and magnetic
      Parker inversions, Euler rotations and poles computations, plate
      tectonic reconstructions, and seismicity and focal mechanism
      plotting. The high quality mapping and cartographic capabilities for
      which GMT is renowned is guaranteed through Mirone's ability to
      automatically generate GMT cshell scripts and dos batch files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mirone is written in MATLAB, a stand-alone version to run
      under Windows is also provided. Regrettably this version is not as

    <h2><a id="NCL" name="NCL">NCL</a></h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/" >NCAR Command Language
      (NCL)</a> is an intepreted programming
      language for scientific data analysis and visualization developed and
      maintained in
      NCAR's <a href="http://www.cisl.ucar.edu/">Computational and Information Systems
      Laboratory</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      NCL has many features common to modern programming languages,
      including types, variables, operators, expressions, conditional
      statements, loops, and functions and procedures.  NCL also has
      features that are not found in other programming languages, including
      those that handle the manipulation of metadata, the configuration of
      visualizations, the import of data from a variety of data formats, and
      an algebra that supports array operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      NCL has robust file input and output capabilities. It allows different
      datasets of different formats (netCDF, netCDF-4 classic, HDF4, HDF4-EOS,
      GRIB-1, and GRIB-2) to
      be imported into one uniform and consistent data manipulation
      environment, which internally is the netCDF data format.  NCL doesn't
      place any restrictions or conventions on the organization of input
      netCDF files.
    </p>
    <p>
      NCL comes with many useful built-in functions and procedures for
      processing and manipulating data. There are over 600 functions and
      procedures that include routines for use specifically with climate and
      model data, empirical orthogonal functions, Fourier
      coefficients, wavelets, singular value decomposition, 1-, 2-, and
      3-dimensional interpolation, approximation, and regridding, and
      computer analysis of scalar and vector global geophysical quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visualizations are publication-quality and highly customizable,
      with hundreds of options available for tweaking the looks of your
      graphics. NCL can generate contours, XY plots, vectors, streamlines,
      and can overlay these plots on many different map projections.  There
      are also specialized functions for generating histograms, wind roses,
      meteograms, skew-T plots, weather maps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Included with the software are two command line tools:
      "ncl_convert2nc" for converting GRIB-1/2 or HDF files to netCDF
      files, and "ncl_filedump" which will dump the contents of a file
      format that NCL recognizes (netCDF, GRIB-1/2, HDF, etc).
    </p>
    <p>
      NCL is available under an open source license or in binary form for
      several popular UNIX platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux,
      MacOSX, and Windows/Cygwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Documentation and additional information on NCL are available from the
      <a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/">NCL website</a>, which contains
      hundreds of <a

    The <a
    href="http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/">NetCDF Toolbox for
    MATLAB-5</a>, originally developed by Charles R. Denham, combined netCDF-3 with <a
    href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a> to form an interface that
    used MATLAB operator-syntax for arithmetic, logical, and subscripting operations
    on netCDF entities.  The NetCDF Toolbox is in bug-fix-only mode, and is
    maintained by John.G.Evans.NE@gmail.com,

    <p>
      <a href="http://ncvtk.sourceforge.net/" >Ncvtk</a> is a program for
      exploring planetary data stored in a NetCDF file.
      The NetCDF file  should loosely follow the <a
      href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/" >CF metadata
      conventions</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ncvtk was designed from the ground up with the aim of offering a high
      degree of interactivity to scientists who have a need to explore
      structured, three-dimensional, time-dependent climate data on the
      sphere. A graphical user interface allows users to interact with their
      data via color/transparency/contour/vector plots, apply vertical slices,
      probe data, apply an external sun light, overlay hydrographic and
      geopolitical data, rotate, zoom, etc. with minimal fuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ncvtk is written in python and is based on the <a
      href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/" >Visualization Toolkit
      (VTK)</a>. Like python and VTK, Ncvtk is
      highly portable and known to run on Windows and Linux (i386, ia64,
      EMT64) platforms. More information about Ncvtk is available at <a

    <h2><a id="netcdf_tools" name="netcdf_tools">Ivan Shmakov's netcdf tools</a></h2>

    <p>
      The NetCDF tools is a free software package consisting of a few
      tools operating on NetCDF and, by utilizing the compatibility API,
      HDF4 files, which are intended to be usable from Shell scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The currently packaged tools are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a couple of simple shell wrappers over the respective NetCDF
        functions (ncattget and ncattput);
      </li>
      <li>
        a more sophisticated ncget tool.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The ncget tool implements functionalilty that is similar to hdp
      dumpsds (for NetCDF, which lacks such a tool), or complements it in
      the case of HDF4. It can be seen as a complement to the ncdump tool
      (included in both the NetCDF and HDF4 distributions) as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool allows a selected part of a NetCDF variable or an HDF4
      scientific data set (SDS) to be extracted in either an ASCII or
      binary form, applying the transformation specified by the usual
      scale_factor and add_offset attributes. It allows one to feed the
      data contained in NetCDF variables (or HDF4 SDS) to the tools
      designed to operate on either ASCII (text) or raw (binary) data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version of the package is the first one to be announced to the
      public. It has some known bugs and limitations, but it's proved to
      be quite usable.  A <a

    <h2><a id="NCMEX" name="NCMEX">Octave interface</a></h2>

    <p>
      The ARM Program has contributed NCMEX for Octave, a port of Chuck
      Denham's MATLAB NCMEX to <a href="http://www.octave.org" >Octave</a>.  The
      calling syntax
      is identical, so scripts using NCMEX in MATLAB should in theory be
      portable to Octave.  In order to build NCMEX, a compiled C NetCDF
      library must already be installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the base NetCDF library interface, this package includes a
      simple toolbox to automate the reading and writing of NetCDf files
      within Octave using NCMEX.  These tools as well as the source for
      NCMEX are available from <a

    <p>
      Alexander Barth has contributed the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      Octcdf is a netCDF toolbox for <a
      href="http://www.octave.org/">Octave</a> which uses the same operator
      syntax as the <a
      href="http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/netcdf_toolbox.html">matlab netCDF
      toolbox</a> of Charles R. Denham. NetCDF dimensions, attributes and
      variables are Octave objects and can be accessed, sliced and changed
      just as regular variables. Unlike most netCDF toolboxes for matlab, it
      does not depend on the NCMEX wrapper around the netCDF interface. This
      octave toolbox is written in C++ calling directly the netCDF library.
      The octcdf toolbox can also be used to download data from an OpenDAP
      server. The octcdf source code is available at <a

    <h2><a id="OPeNDAP" name="OPeNDAP">OPeNDAP (formerly DODS)</a></h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="http://opendap.org/">OPeNDAP</a> (formerly known as
      DODS) is an Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol
      that makes local data and subsets of local data accessible to remote
      locations independent of the local storage format. OPeNDAP also
      provides tools for transforming existing applications into OPeNDAP
      clients, enabling them to remotely access OPeNDAP served data.
      OPeNDAP is based on existing data access tools; rather than developing
      a self contained system, it makes extensive use of existing data
      access APIs.
    </p>

    <p>
      OPeNDAP can be used to make netCDF data files available over the
      Internet and it can also be used to adapt existing software which use
      the netCDF API (by re-linking) to read data served by an OPeNDAP data
      server. In principle, any program written using netCDF can be adapted
      to read data from an OPeNDAP server - in other words any program
      which uses netCDF can become a client in the OPeNDAP client-server
      system. Included in the source and binary distributions are two freely
      available programs that have already been modified (re-linked).
    </p>

    <p>
      With a client program accessing data from a netCDF server, it is
      possible to access a small subset of a large dataset over the Internet
      without copying the entire dataset (as you would have to do with FTP
      or AFS). The client can see changes to the netCDF dataset, e.g. when
      new records are added (which would not be possible with FTP). Finally,
      the client can also access cross-sections of variable data without
      paging large amounts of data across the network (as you would have to
      do with NFS, for example).

      OPeNDAP software is freely available in both
      source form or binary form for selected platforms.

    <h2><a id="OpenDX" name="OpenDX">OpenDX</a></h2>
    <a href="http://www.opendx.org/about.html">OpenDX</a> (formerly IBM Data Explorer,
    also known as simply DX) is a general-purpose software package for data visualization
    and analysis. It employs a data-flow driven client-server execution model and
    provides a graphical program editor that allows the user to create a visualization
    using a point and click interface.
    <p>
      DX runs on 7 major UNIX platforms as well as Windows 95/NT and is designed
      to take full advantage of multi-processor systems from IBM, SGI and Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      DX is built upon an internal data model, which describes and provides uniform
      access services for any data brought into, generated by, or exported from the
      software. This data model supports a number of different classes of scientific
      data, which can be described by their shape (size and number of dimensions),
      rank (e.g., scalar, vector, tensor), type (float, integer, byte, etc. or real,
      complex, quaternion), where the data are located in space (positions), how the
      locations are related to each other (connections), aggregates or groups (e.g.,
      hierarchies, series, composites, multizone grids, etc.). It also supports those
      entities required for graphics and imaging operations within the context of
      Data Explorer. Regular and irregular, deformed or curvilinear, structured and
      unstructured data as well as &quot;missing&quot; or invalid data are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The details of the data model are hidden at the user level. As a result DX
      operations or modules are polymorphic and appear typeless. The DX Import module,
      which reads data for use within Data Explorer directly utilizes data in netCDF
      as well as other formats (e.g., HDF, CDF). One or more variables may be selected
      as well as step(s) of a time series. Data in conventional netCDFs are directly
      imported. Since the DX data model is more comprehensive than the netCDF data
      model, a methodology to extend netCDF via attribute conventions (e.g., for unstructured
      meshes, non-scalar data and hierarchies) for use with Data Explorer is available.
    </p>
    <p>
      DX supports a number of realization techniques for generating renderable geometry
      from data. These include color and opacity mapping (e.g., for surface and volume
      rendering), contours and isosurfaces, histograms, two-dimensional and three-dimensional
      plotting, surface deformation, etc. for scalar data. For vector data, arrow
      plots, streamlines, streaklines, etc. are provided. Realizations may be annotated
      with ribbons, tubes, axes, glyphs, text and display of data locations, meshes
      and boundaries. Data probing, picking, arbitrary surface and volume sampling,
      and arbitrary cutting/mapping planes are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      DX supports a number of non-graphical functions such as point-wise mathematical
      expressions (e.g., arithmetic, transcendental, boolean, type conversion, etc.),
      univariate statistics and image processing (e.g., transformation, filter, warp,
      edge detection, convolution, equalization, blending, morphological operations,
      etc.). Field/vector operations such as divergence, gradient and curl, dot and
      cross products, etc. are provided. Non-gridded or scattered data may be interpolated
      to an arbitrary grid or triangulated, depending on the analysis requirements.
      The length, area or volume of various geometries may also be computed. Tools
      for data manipulation such as removal of data points, subsetting by position,
      sub/supersampling, grid construction, mapping, interpolation, regridding, transposition,
      etc. are available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools for doing cartographic projections and registration as well as earth,
      space and environmental sciences examples are available at Cornell University
      via info.tc.cornell.edu. Also see the <a href="#ncdx" >ncdx</a> tool for making

      Currently supported 3D visualizations are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Shaded isosurface
      </li>
      <li>
        Transparent contour shells or isosurfaces at varying levels
      </li>
      <li>
        Volumetric or density plot
      </li>
      <li>
        Planes
      </li>
      <li>
        Contour ribbons
      </li>
      <li>
        Topographic surface from 2D geographic data sets
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      3D data volumes may be sliced in the X, Y, or Z plane using an interactive
      cutting plane. A cross section of the data volume can be viewed in a 2D window
      as a 2D contour plot, a vector plot, a raster image or a combination of these
      options superimposed. Map outlines can be used as a background for 2D cross
      section plots of geographic data. All data is projected according to the coordinates
      specified by the user for the cross section window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user interface provides direct manipulation tools for specifying the eye
      position, center of view, light sources, and color ramps. Subsetting of data
      can be done easily by selecting the data by index or geographic coordinate.
      On-line contextual help provides easy access to more detail about the software.
      Tutorials which range from very simple visualizations to complex combinations
      of data sets provide the user with a quick learning tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently PolyPaint+ accepts only data which is in the NetCDF file format.
      A file conversion utility which converts from raw binary data to netCDf is a
      part of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      PolyPaint+ is a joint effort of the University of Colorado and NCAR (National
      Center for Atmospheric Research) funded by the NASA AISRP program. A beta version
      of PolyPaint+ is currently available free of charge using FTP or for a nominal
      fee which would cover tape distribution. A license agreement must be signed
      in order to use it.

      is aimed at manipulation and visualization of multidimensional data
      sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scientific DataSet (or SDS in short) is a .NET class library for
      manipulating scientific data  and their metadata. SDS provides a unified API
      for convenient access to various data storages. Three types of storages are
      supported by the first release: NetCDF files, CSV text files and volatile
      in-memory datasets. SDS uses native NetCDF library built from version 4.0.1
      both for 32 and 64-bit Windows platforms. New storage types can be added to
      SDS infractructure as plugins. Support for accessing TIFF image files from
      SDS as 2D arrays will be available soon as a separate CodePlex project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three applications are built on top of SDS:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        sds command line utility. It allows users to examine data set schema,
        copy data sets, modify their metadata.
      </li>
      <li>
        DataSetViewer application for visualization of data sets. DataSetViewer
        is both a standalone application and Windows Presentation Foundation Control
        that can be built into your applications. DataSetViewer has support for
        interactive slicing of multidimensional data along any dimension.
      </li>
      <li>
        DataSetEditor add-in for Microsoft Office Excel. DataSetEditor provides
        ability to view and modify the contents of any data set as Excel
        worksheets.

      developing geospatial applications. SIS enables representation of
      coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
      relevant spatial needs. The library is an implementation of GeoAPI 3.0
      interfaces and can be used for desktop or server applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIS provides data structures for geographic data and associated
      metadata along with methods to manipulate those data structures. The
      SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and enables the
      creation of metadata objects which comply with the ISO 19115 metadata
      model and which can be read from or written to ISO 19139 compliant XML
      documents. The SIS referencing module will enable the construction of
      geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing based on the ISO
      19111 model such as axis, projection and coordinate reference system
      definitions, along with the associated operations which enable the
      mathematical conversion of coordinates between different systems of
      reference. The SIS storage modules will provide a common approach to
      the reading and writing of grid coverages applicable to simple imagery
      and multidimensional data structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIS supports creating ISO 19115 metadata from metadata in a netCDF
      store from a given file, URL, stream, or NetcdfFile object.  SIS
      netCDF storage is intended to be a bridge between NetCDF Climate and
      Forecast (CF) conventions and ISO 19115 metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIS is under developement as an Apache project.  Release 0.3 is
      currently available for download.

      provided in multiple formats. The data export feature
      supports conversion of data to a variety of common formats
      including GeoJSON, KMZ, Shapefile, Well-Known Text, GeoTIFF,
      ESRI Grid and Gridded NetCDF. These data export features
      promote the interoperability of weather and climate
      information with various scientific communities and common
      software packages such as ArcGIS, Google Earth, MatLAB,
      QGIS, R and many more. Advanced data export support for
      Google Earth enables the 2-D and 3D export of rendered data

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.openchannelsoftware.com/projects/WebWinds/"> WebWinds</a> is a free Java-based
      science visualization and analysis package. In addition to several new analysis
      tools, the current fourth version does automatic scripting. This allows
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        a user to rapidly and automatically create and store a session, either
        for his own use, or for use by a collaborator on another machine;
      </li>
      <li>
        a data provider to automatically create a specialized analysis environment
        which can be downloaded (as a small script file) along with a dataset from
        a Website; and
      </li>
      <li>
        realtime collaboration or sharing of sessions over (even low-bandwidth)
        networks, including the Internet.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This scripting requires no knowledge of the scripting language syntax. Several
      sample script files are included with the distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, this version contains a capability to geo-reference some data
      and to read ASCII data in tabular format. Also new is the ability to output
      data in numerical form (e.g. NetCDF) and a context sensitive, integrated help
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with earlier versions, data in several different formats, including NetCDF,
      can be read in easily from your local machine or from the Web. In addition,
      most data can be subset or subsampled on load, making it possible to visualize
      very large multidimensional and/or multispectral datasets. The package includes
      several step-by-step examples. Installation of the software (including Java)
      on the PC or Mac is a process requiring one file to be downloaded and opened.
      If you need help getting started, a remote tutorial is available once you've
      downloaded the package.
    </p>
    <p>
      WebWinds is `point and click' rather than language driven and it runs well
      on Unix, Windows (95/98/NT) and Mac platforms. It currently requires JDK 1.1.

    <h2><a id="Zebra" name="Zebra">Zebra</a></h2>
    <a href="http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/zebra.html">Zebra</a> (formerly named Zeb)
    is a system for data ingest, storage, integration and display, designed to operate
    in both real time and postprocessing modes. Zebra was developed by Jonathan Corbet
    and others in NCAR&#39;s <a
    href="http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/rdp_home.html">Research Data Program</a>.
    <p>
      Zebra&#39;s primary use is for the superpositioning of observational data sets
      (such as those collected by satellite, radar, mesonet and aircraft) and analysis
      products (such as model results, dual-Doppler synthesis or algorithm output).
      Data may be overlaid on a variety of display types, including constant altitude
      planes, vertical cross-sections, X-Y graphs, Skew-T plots and time-height profiles.
      The fields for display, color tables, contour intervals and various other display
      options are defined using an icon based user-interface. This highly flexible
      system allows scientific investigators to interactively superimpose and highlight
      diverse data sets; thus aiding data interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data handling capabilities permit external analysis programs to be easily linked
      with display and data storage processes. The data store accepts incoming data,
      stores it on disk, and makes it available to processes which need it. An application
      library is available for data handling. The library functions allow data storage,
      retrieval and queries using a single applications interface, regardless of the
      data&#39;s source and organization. NetCDF data that conforms to Zebra conventions
      is supported by this interface.

It includes a toolset for visualizing the data stored in the space-time netCDF cube in both 2D and 3D.

      Create Space Time Cube takes point datasets and builds a multidimensional cube data structure (netCDF) for analysis. Emerging Hot Spot Analysis then takes the cube as input and identifies statistically significant hot and cold spot trends over time. You might use the Emerging Hot Spot Analysis tool to analyze crime or disease outbreak data in order to locate new, intensifying, persistent, or sporadic hot spot patterns at different time-step intervals. The Local Outlier Analysis tool takes the cube as input to identify statistically significant clusters of high or low values as well as outliers that have values that are statistically different than their neighbors in space and time. The Utilities toolset enables you to visualize the data and analysis results stored in the space-time cube in two and three dimensions. These visualization tools can be used to understand the structure of the cube, how the cube aggregation process works, and to visualize the analytical results added to the cube by other Space Time Pattern Mining tools. See Visualizing the Space Time Cube for strategies to allow you to look at cube contents.

    click to specify the name of the variable in the selected netCDF file, as well
    as selecting the hyperslab. If 1D coordinate variables exist (a variable that
    has the same name as a dimension) then the coordinate variable will be used to
    specify the coordinates of resulting rectilinear field file. If no coordinate
    variable exists, then the resulting field file will be uniform. Once in AVS, there
    are hundreds of analysis and display modules available for image processing, isosurface
    rendering, arbitrary slicing, alpha blending, streamline and vorticity calculation,
    particle advection, etc. AVS runs on many different platforms (Stardent, DEC,

      the main objections heard from "technologists" (e.g., scientists,
      engineers, and other researchers) who avoid using databases to manage
      their data: "my very large data files are too
      cumbersome/difficult/slow/costly to load into a database".  In
      addition to netCDF, these files come in a variety of formats (HDF5, GRIB,
      NITFS, FITS, etc.).

      database extension based on the IBM Informix Virtual Table Interface
      (VTI). <em>(Please continue reading even if you don't have
      Informix running on your system, because IBM has just made available, at

      VTI is a technology that supports making external datasets appear as tables
      to SQL queries and statements.  UFI is a BCS database extension for
      delivering the contents of external data files as though they were rows in
      a database table.  UFI makes a file look like a set of database tables, so
      "UFI managed tables" are actually virtual database tables.   Consequently,
      users of UFI can perform SQL queries on their files without having to first
      load them into a database.

    is a scientific computing environment, developed and supported by <a
    href="http://www.exelisvis.com/" >Excelis Visual Information
    Solutions</a>, that combines mathematics, advanced data
    visualization, scientific graphics, and a graphical user interface toolkit to
    analyze and visualize scientific data. Designed for use by scientists and scientific
    application developers, IDL&#39;s array-oriented, fourth-generation programming
    language allows you to prototype and develop complete applications. IDL now supports
    data in netCDF format.
    <p>
      As an example, here is how to read data from a netCDF variable named GP in
      a file named &quot;data/aprin.nc&quot; into an IDL variable named gp using the
      IDL language:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <pre>
      id = ncdf_open(&#39;data/april.nc&#39;)
      ncdf_varget,id, ncdf_varid( id, &#39;GP&#39;), gp
      </pre>
      Now you can visualize the data in the gp variable in a large variety of ways and
      use it in other computations in IDL. You can FTP a demo version of IDL, including
      the netCDF interface, by following the instructions in pub/idl/README available
      via anonymous FTP from gateway.rsinc.com or boulder.colorado.edu.

      The Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Group at the National Center for Supercomputing
      Applications (NCSA) and the Mesoscale Dynamics and Precipitation Branch at NASA-Goddard
      Space Flight Center have developed the NCSA PATHFINDER module set for <a
      href="http://www.nag.co.uk:70/1h/Welcome_IEC">IRIS Explorer</a>. Two of the modules, <a
      href="http://redrock.ncsa.uiuc.edu/PATHFINDER/pathrel2/explorer/ReadDFG/ReadDFG.html"> ReadDFG</a> (to output Grids), and <a
      href="http://redrock.ncsa.uiuc.edu/PATHFINDER/pathrel2/explorer/ReadDF/ReadDF.html"> ReadDF</a> (to output Lattices) are capable of reading from NCSA HDF files, MFHDF/3.3
      files, and Unidata netCDF files. A user-friendly interface provides control and
      information about the contents of the files.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ReadDF, the format translation is handled transparently. Up to five unique
      lattices may be generated from the file (as these files can contain multiple
      data fields) using a single module. A variety of dimensionalities and data types
      are supported also. Multiple variables may be combined in a single lattice to
      generate vector data. All three Explorer coordinate systems are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      With ReadDFG, user selected variables from the file are output in up to five
      PATHFINDER grids. Each grid can consist of scalar data from one variable or
      vector data from multiple variables. Coordinate information from the file is
      also included in the grids. Any number of dimensions in any of the Explorer
      coordinate types are supported.
    </p>
