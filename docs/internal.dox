\page nc_dispatch Internal Dispatch Table Architecture

This document describes the architecture and details of the netCDF
internal dispatch mechanism. The idea is that when a user opens or
creates a netcdf file, a specific dispatch table is chosen.
A dispatch table is a struct containing an entry for every function
in the netcdf-c API. 
Subsequent netcdf API calls are then channeled through that
dispatch table to the appropriate function for implementing that API
call. The functions in the dispatch table are not quite the same
as those defined in netcdf.h. For simplicity and compactness,
some netcdf.h API calls are
mapped to the same dispatch table function. In addition to
the functions, the first entry in the table defines the model
that this dispatch table implements. It will be one of the
NC_FORMATX_XXX values.

The list of supported dispatch tables will grow over time.
To date, at least the following dispatch tables are supported.
- netcdf classic files (netcdf-3)
- netcdf enhanced files (netcdf-4)
- DAP2 to netcdf-3
- DAP4 to netcdf-4
- pnetcdf (parallel cdf5)
- HDF4 SD files

Internal Dispatch Tables

- \subpage put_vara_dispatch
- \subpage put_attr_dispatch

The dispatch table represents a distillation of the netcdf API down to
a minimal set of internal operations. The format of the dispatch table
is defined in the file libdispatch/ncdispatch.h. Every new dispatch
table must define this minimal set of operations.

\page adding_dispatch Adding a New Dispatch Table

\tableofcontents

In order to make this process concrete, let us assume we plan to add
an in-memory implementation of netcdf-3.

\section dispatch_configure_ac Defining configure.ac flags

Define a –-enable flag and an AM_CONFIGURE flag in configure.ac.
For our example, we assume the option "--enable-ncm" and the AM_CONFIGURE
flag "ENABLE_NCM". If you examine the existing configure.ac and see how,
for example, dap2 is defined, then it should be clear how to do it for
your code.

\section dispatch_namespace Defining a "name space"

Choose some prefix of characters to identify the new dispatch
system. In effect we are defining a name-space. For our in-memory
system, we will choose "NCM" and "ncm". NCM is used for non-static
procedures to be entered into the dispatch table and ncm for all other
non-static procedures.

\section dispatch_netcdf_h Extend include/netcdf.h

Modify file include/netcdf.h to add an NC_FORMATX_XXX flag
by adding a flag for this dispatch format at the appropriate places.

\code
              #define NC_FORMATX_NCM  7
\endcode

Add any format specific new error codes.

\code
              #define NC_ENCM  (?)
\endcode

\section dispatch_ncdispatch Extend include/ncdispatch.h

Modify file include/ncdispatch.h as follows.

Add format specific data and functions; note the of our NCM namespace.

\code
              #ifdef ENABLE_NCM
              extern NC_Dispatch* NCM_dispatch_table;
              extern int NCM_initialize(void);
              #endif
\endcode

\section dispatch_define_code Define the dispatch table functions

Define the functions necessary to fill in the dispatch table. As a
rule, we assume that a new directory is defined, libsrcm, say. Within
this directory, we need to define Makefile.am and CMakeLists.txt.
We also need to define the source files
containing the dispatch table and the functions to be placed in the
dispatch table – call them ncmdispatch.c and ncmdispatch.h. Look at
libsrc/nc3dispatch.[ch] or libdap4/ncd4dispatch.[ch] for examples.

Similarly, it is best to take existing Makefile.am and CMakeLists.txt
files (from libdap4 for example) and modify them.

\section dispatch_lib Adding the dispatch code to libnetcdf

Provide for the inclusion of this library in the final libnetcdf
library. This is accomplished by modifying liblib/Makefile.am by
adding something like the following.

\code
     if ENABLE_NCM
        libnetcdf_la_LIBADD += $(top_builddir)/libsrcm/libnetcdfm.la
     endif
\endcode

\section dispatch_init Extend library initialization

Modify the NC_initialize function in liblib/nc_initialize.c by adding
appropriate references to the NCM dispatch function.

\code
     #ifdef ENABLE_NCM
     extern int NCM_initialize(void);
     #endif
     ...
     int NC_initialize(void)
     {
     ...
     #ifdef USE_DAP
         if((stat = NCM_initialize())) return stat;
     #endif
     ...
     }
\endcode

\section dispatch_tests Testing the new dispatch table

Add a directory of tests; ncm_test, say. The file ncm_test/Makefile.am
will look something like this.

\code
     # These files are created by the tests.
     CLEANFILES = ...
     # These are the tests which are always run.
     TESTPROGRAMS = test1 test2 ...
     test1_SOURCES = test1.c ...
     ...
     # Set up the tests.
     check_PROGRAMS = $(TESTPROGRAMS)
     TESTS = $(TESTPROGRAMS)
     # Any extra files required by the tests
     EXTRA_DIST = ...
\endcode

\section dispatch_toplevel Top-Level build of the dispatch code

Provide for libnetcdfm to be constructed by adding the following to
the top-level Makefile.am.

\code
     if ENABLE_NCM
     NCM=libsrcm
     NCMTESTDIR=ncm_test
     endif
     ...
     SUBDIRS = ... $(DISPATCHDIR)  $(NCM) ... $(NCMTESTDIR)
\endcode

\section choosing_dispatch_table Choosing a Dispatch Table

The dispatch table is chosen in the NC_create and the NC_open
procedures in libdispatch/netcdf.c.
This can be, unfortunately, a complex process.

The decision is currently based on the following pieces of information.
Using a mode flag is the most common mechanism, in which case
netcdf.h needs to be modified to define the relevant mode flag.

1. The mode argument – this can be used to detect, for example, what kind
of file to create: netcdf-3, netcdf-4, 64-bit netcdf-3, etc.  For
nc_open and when the file path references a real file, the contents of
the file can also be used to determine the dispatch table.  Although
currently not used, this code could be modified to also use other
pieces of information such as environment variables.

2. The file path – this can be used to detect, for example, a DAP url
versus a normal file system file.

When adding a new dispatcher, it is necessary to modify NC_create and
NC_open in libdispatch/dfile.c to detect when it is appropriate to
use the NCM dispatcher. Some possibilities are as follows.
- Add a new mode flag: say NC_NETCDFM.
- Define a special file path format that indicates the need to use a
  special dispatch table.

\section special_dispatch Special Dispatch Table Signatures.

Several of the entries in the dispatch table are significantly
different than those of the external API.

\subsection create_open_dispatch Create/Open

The create table entry and the open table entry in the dispatch table
have the following signatures respectively.

\code
     int (*create)(const char *path, int cmode,
                size_t initialsz, int basepe, size_t *chunksizehintp,
                int useparallel, void* parameters,
                struct NC_Dispatch* table, NC* ncp);
\endcode

\code
     int (*open)(const char *path, int mode,
              int basepe, size_t *chunksizehintp,
              int use_parallel, void* parameters,
              struct NC_Dispatch* table, NC* ncp);
\endcode

The key difference is that these are the union of all the possible
create/open signatures from the include/netcdfXXX.h files. Note especially the last
three parameters. The parameters argument is a pointer to arbitrary data
to provide extra info to the dispatcher.
The table argument is included in case the create
function (e.g. NCM_create) needs to invoke other dispatch
functions. The very last argument, ncp, is a pointer to an NC
instance. The raw NC instance will have been created by libdispatch/dfile.c
and is passed to e.g. open with the expectation that it will be filled in
by the dispatch open function.

\page put_vara_dispatch Accessing Data with put_vara() and get_vara()

\code
     int (*put_vara)(int ncid, int varid, const size_t *start, const size_t *count,
                          const void *value, nc_type memtype);
\endcode

\code
     int (*get_vara)(int ncid, int varid, const size_t *start, const size_t *count,
                     void *value, nc_type memtype);
\endcode

Most of the parameters are similar to the netcdf API parameters. The
last parameter, however, is the type of the data in
memory. Additionally, instead of using an "int islong" parameter, the
memtype will be either ::NC_INT or ::NC_INT64, depending on the value
of sizeof(long). This means that even netcdf-3 code must be prepared
to encounter the ::NC_INT64 type.

\page put_attr_dispatch Accessing Attributes with put_attr() and get_attr()

\code
     int (*get_att)(int ncid, int varid, const char *name,
                         void *value, nc_type memtype);
\endcode

\code
     int (*put_att)(int ncid, int varid, const char *name, nc_type datatype, size_t len,
                    const void *value, nc_type memtype);
\endcode

Again, the key difference is the memtype parameter. As with
put/get_vara, it used ::NC_INT64 to encode the long case.

\subsection Pre-defined Dispatch Functions

It is usually not necessary to implement all the functions in the
dispatch table. Some pre-defined functions are available which may be
used in many cases.

\subsubsection Inquiry Functions

The netCDF inquiry functions operate from an in-memory model of
metadata. Once a file has been opened, or as a file is created, this
in-memory metadata model is kept up to date. Consequenty the inquiry
functions do not depend on the dispatch layer code. These functions
can be used by all dispatch layers which use the internal netCDF
enhanced data model.

- NC4_inq
- NC4_inq_type
- NC4_inq_dimid
- NC4_inq_dim
- NC4_inq_unlimdim
- NC4_inq_att
- NC4_inq_attid
- NC4_inq_attname
- NC4_get_att
- NC4_inq_varid
- NC4_inq_var_all
- NC4_show_metadata
- NC4_inq_unlimdims
- NC4_inq_ncid
- NC4_inq_grps
- NC4_inq_grpname
- NC4_inq_grpname_full
- NC4_inq_grp_parent
- NC4_inq_grp_full_ncid
- NC4_inq_varids
- NC4_inq_dimids
- NC4_inq_typeids
- NC4_inq_type_equal
- NC4_inq_user_type
- NC4_inq_typeid

\subsubsection NCDEFAULT get/put Functions

The strided (vars) and mapped (varm) get/put functions have been
implemented in terms of the array (vara) functions. So dispatch layers
need only implement the vara functions, and can use the following
functions to get the vars and varm functions:

- NCDEFAULT_get_vars
- NCDEFAULT_put_vars
- NCDEFAULT_get_varm
- NCDEFAULT_put_varm

\subsubsection Read-Only Functions

Some dispatch layers are read-only (ex. HDF4). Any function which
writes to a file, including nc_create(), needs to return error code
::NC_EPERM. The following read-only functions are available so that
these don't have to be re-implemented in each read-only dispatch
layer:

- NC_RO_create
- NC_RO_redef
- NC_RO__enddef
- NC_RO_sync
- NC_RO_set_fill
- NC_RO_def_dim
- NC_RO_rename_dim
- NC_RO_rename_att
- NC_RO_del_att
- NC_RO_put_att
- NC_RO_def_var
- NC_RO_rename_var
- NC_RO_put_vara
- NC_RO_def_var_fill

\subsubsection Classic NetCDF Only Functions

There are two functions that are only used in the classic code. All
other dispatch layers (except pnetcdf) return error ::NC_ENOTNC3 for
these functions. The following functions are provided for this
purpose:

- NOTNC3_inq_base_pe
- NOTNC3_set_base_pe

\section HDF4 Dispatch Layer as a Simple Example

The HDF4 dispatch layer is about the simplest possible dispatch
layer. It is read-only, classic model. It will serve as a nice, simple
example of a dispatch layer.

Note that the HDF4 layer is optional in the netCDF build. Not all
users will have HDF4 installed, and those users will not build with
the HDF4 dispatch layer enabled. For this reason HDF4 code is guarded
with #ifdef(USE_HDF4). Code in libhdf4 is only compiled if HDF4 is
turned on in the build.

\subsection Header File Changes in include Directory

\subsubsection The netcdf.h File

In the main netcdf.h file, we have the following:

\code
#define NC_FORMATX_NC_HDF4   (3) /**< netCDF-4 subset of HDF4 */
#define NC_FORMAT_NC_HDF4   NC_FORMATX_NC_HDF4 /**< \deprecated As of 4.4.0, use NC_FORMATX_NC_HDF4 */
\endcode

\subsubsection The ncdispatch.h File

In ncdispatch.h we have the following:

\code
#ifdef USE_HDF4
extern NC_Dispatch* HDF4_dispatch_table;
extern int HDF4_initialize(void);
extern int HDF4_finalize(void);
#endif
\endcode

\subsubsection The netcdf_meta.h File

The netcdf_meta.h file allows for easy determination of what features
are in use. It contains the following, set by configure:

\code
#define NC_HAS_HDF4      1 /*!< hdf4 support. */
\endcode

\subsubsection The hdf4dispatch.h File

We also have the file hdf4dispatch.h, which contains prototypes and
macro definitions used within the HDF4 code in libhdf4. This include
file should not be used anywhere except in libhdf4.

\subsection Initialization Code Changes in liblib Directory

In the file nc_initialize.c we have the following:

\code
#ifdef USE_HDF4
extern int HDF4_initialize(void);
extern int HDF4_finalize(void);
#endif
\endcode

\subsection Dispatch Code Changes in libdispatch Directory

\subsubsection Changes to dfile.c

In order for a dispatch layer to be used, it must be correctly
determined in functions NC_open() or NC_create() in dfile.c.

HDF4 has a magic number that is detected in
NC_interpret_magic_number(), which allows NC_open to automatically
detect a HDF4 file. Other dispatch layers may need to set a mode flag.

Once HDF4 is detected, model variable is set to NC_FORMATX_NC_HDF4,
and later this is used in a case statement:

\code
      case NC_FORMATX_NC_HDF4:
         dispatcher = HDF4_dispatch_table;
         break;
\endcode

This sets the dispatcher to the HDF4 dispatcher, which is defined in
the libhdf4 directory.

\subsection Dispatch Code in libhdf4

\subsubsection Dispatch Table in hdf4dispatch.c

The file hdf4dispatch.c contains the definition of the HDF4 dispatch
table. It looks like this:

\code
/* This is the dispatch object that holds pointers to all the
 * functions that make up the HDF4 dispatch interface. */
static NC_Dispatch HDF4_dispatcher = {
NC_FORMATX_NC_HDF4,
NC_RO_create,
NC_HDF4_open,
NC_RO_redef,
NC_RO__enddef,
NC_RO_sync,

...

NC_NOTNC4_set_var_chunk_cache,
NC_NOTNC4_get_var_chunk_cache,
};
\endcode

Note that most functions use some of the predefined dispatch
functions. Functions that start with NC_RO_ are read-only, they return
::NC_EPERM. Functions that start with NOTNC4_ return ::NC_ENOTNC4.

Only the functions that start with NC_HDF4_ need to be implemented for
the HDF4 dispatch layer. There are 6 such functions:

- NC_HDF4_open
- NC_HDF4_abort
- NC_HDF4_close
- NC_HDF4_inq_format
- NC_HDF4_inq_format_extended
- NC_HDF4_get_vara

\subsubsection HDF4 Reading Code

The code in hdf4file.c opens the HDF4 SD dataset, and reads the
metadata. This metadata is stored in the netCDF internal metadata
model, allowing the inq functions to work.

The code in hdf4var.c does an nc_get_vara() on the HDF4 SD
dataset. This is all that is needed for all the nc_get_* functions to
work.
