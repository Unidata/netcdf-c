# CTest Script Directory

This directory contains ctest scripts which upload the results to the [NetCDF CDash Dashboard](https://cdash.unidata.ucar.edu).  These scripts require an environmental variable, `CDASH_TOKEN`, to submit results.  This is primarily a Unidata tool, but for users who want to submit results, a token can be requested by emailing support-netcdf@unidata.ucar.edu.
