# Define a function that attempts to locate a
# plugin with a given canonical name.
# Assumptions:
#   1. plugins is a top-level directory, possibly in "build"
# Inputs:
#   $1 is the canonical name
#   $2 is 1 if we are running under cmake
#   $3 is 1 if we are running using Visual Studio, blank otherwise
#   $4 is the build type; only used if $3 is 1
# Optional Input:
#   HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable
# Outputs:
#   return code is 0 is success, 1 if failed
#   Variable HDF5_PLUGIN_LIB is set to the library file name
#   Variable HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH is setthe absolute path to the
#                    directory containing the plugin library file
# Local variables are prefixed with FP_
#
# Note: we assume that the use of the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
# is obviated by setting the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
# variables: see hdf5plugins/CMakeLists.txt
