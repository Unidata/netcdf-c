/** \defgroup datasets NetCDF File and Data I/O

    NetCDF opens datasets as files or remote access URLs.

    A netCDF dataset that has not yet been opened can only be referred to
    by its dataset name. Once a netCDF dataset is opened, it is referred
    to by a netCDF ID, which is a small non-negative integer returned when
    you create or open the dataset. A netCDF ID is much like a file
    descriptor in C or a logical unit number in FORTRAN. In any single
    program, the netCDF IDs of distinct open netCDF datasets are
    distinct. A single netCDF dataset may be opened multiple times and
    will then have multiple distinct netCDF IDs; however at most one of
    the open instances of a single netCDF dataset should permit
    writing. When an open netCDF dataset is closed, the ID is no longer
    associated with a netCDF dataset.

    Functions that deal with the netCDF library include:
    - Get version of library.
    - Get error message corresponding to a returned error code.

    The operations supported on a netCDF dataset as a single object are:
    - Create, given dataset name and whether to overwrite or not.
    - Open for access, given dataset name and read or write intent.
    - Put into define mode, to add dimensions, variables, or attributes.
    - Take out of define mode, checking consistency of additions.
    - Close, writing to disk if required.
    - Inquire about the number of dimensions, number of variables,
    number of global attributes, and ID of the unlimited dimension, if
    any.
    - Synchronize to disk to make sure it is current.
    - Set and unset nofill mode for optimized sequential writes.
    - After a summary of conventions used in describing the netCDF
    interfaces, the rest of this chapter presents a detailed description
    of the interfaces for these operations.

/**
 * Add handling of user-defined format.

 * User-defined formats allow users to write a library which can read

 * User-defined formats work by specifying a netCDF dispatch

/**  \ingroup datasets
     Create a new netCDF file.

     This function creates a new netCDF dataset, returning a netCDF ID that
     can subsequently be used to refer to the netCDF dataset in other
     netCDF function calls. The new netCDF dataset opened for write access
     and placed in define mode, ready for you to add dimensions, variables,
     and attributes.

     \param path The file name of the new netCDF dataset.

     \param cmode The creation mode flag. The following flags are available:
     NC_CLOBBER (overwrite existing file),
     NC_NOCLOBBER (do not overwrite existing file),
     NC_SHARE (limit write caching - netcdf classic files only),
     NC_64BIT_OFFSET (create 64-bit offset file),
     NC_64BIT_DATA (alias NC_CDF5) (create CDF-5 file),
     NC_NETCDF4 (create netCDF-4/HDF5 file),
     NC_CLASSIC_MODEL (enforce netCDF classic mode on netCDF-4/HDF5 files),
     NC_DISKLESS (store data in memory), and
     NC_PERSIST (force the NC_DISKLESS data from memory to a file),
     NC_MMAP (use MMAP for NC_DISKLESS instead of NC_INMEMORY -- deprecated).
     See discussion below.

     \param ncidp Pointer to location where returned netCDF ID is to be
     stored.

     <h2>The cmode Flag</h2>

     The cmode flag is used to control the type of file created, and some
     aspects of how it may be used.

     Setting NC_NOCLOBBER means you do not want to clobber (overwrite) an
     existing dataset; an error (NC_EEXIST) is returned if the specified
     dataset already exists.

     The NC_SHARE flag is appropriate when one process may be writing the
     dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
     concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
     caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
     sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially may
     see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag. This
     flag is ignored for netCDF-4 files.

     Setting NC_64BIT_OFFSET causes netCDF to create a 64-bit offset format
     file, instead of a netCDF classic format file. The 64-bit offset
     format imposes far fewer restrictions on very large (i.e. over 2 GB)
     data files. See Large File Support.

     Setting NC_64BIT_DATA (alias NC_CDF5) causes netCDF to create a CDF-5
     file format that supports large files (i.e. over 2GB) and large
     variables (over 2B array elements.). See Large File Support.

     A zero value (defined for convenience as NC_CLOBBER) specifies the
     default behavior: overwrite any existing dataset with the same file
     name and buffer and cache accesses for efficiency. The dataset will be
     in netCDF classic format. See NetCDF Classic Format Limitations.

     Setting NC_NETCDF4 causes netCDF to create a HDF5/NetCDF-4 file.

     Setting NC_CLASSIC_MODEL causes netCDF to enforce the classic data
     model in this file. (This only has effect for netCDF-4/HDF5 files, as
     CDF-1, 2 and 5 files always use the classic model.) When
     used with NC_NETCDF4, this flag ensures that the resulting
     netCDF-4/HDF5 file may never contain any new constructs from the
     enhanced data model. That is, it cannot contain groups, user defined
     types, multiple unlimited dimensions, or new atomic types. The
     advantage of this restriction is that such files are guaranteed to
     work with existing netCDF software.

     Setting NC_DISKLESS causes netCDF to create the file only in
     memory and to optionally write the final contents to the
     correspondingly named disk file. This allows for the use of
     files that have no long term purpose. Operating on an existing file
     in memory may also be faster. The decision on whether
     or not to "persist" the memory contents to a disk file is
     described in detail in the file docs/inmemory.md, which is
     definitive.  By default, closing a diskless fill will cause it's
     contents to be lost.

     If NC_DISKLESS is going to be used for creating a large classic
     file, it behooves one to use nc__create and specify an
     appropriately large value of the initialsz parameter to avoid to
     many extensions to the in-memory space for the file.  This flag
     applies to files in classic format and to file in extended
     format (netcdf-4).

     Note that nc_create(path,cmode,ncidp) is equivalent to the invocation of
     nc__create(path,cmode,NC_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT,NULL,ncidp).

     \returns ::NC_NOERR No error.
     \returns ::NC_EEXIST Specifying a file name of a file that exists and also specifying NC_NOCLOBBER.
     \returns ::NC_EPERM Attempting to create a netCDF file in a directory where you do not have permission to create files.
     \returns ::NC_ENOMEM System out of memory.
     \returns ::NC_ENFILE Too many files open.
     \returns ::NC_EHDFERR HDF5 error (netCDF-4 files only).
     \returns ::NC_EFILEMETA Error writing netCDF-4 file-level metadata in
     HDF5 file. (netCDF-4 files only).
     \returns ::NC_EDISKLESS if there was an error in creating the
     in-memory file.

     \note When creating a netCDF-4 file HDF5 error reporting is turned
     off, if it is on. This doesn't stop the HDF5 error stack from
     recording the errors, it simply stops their display to the user
     through stderr.

     <h1>Examples</h1>

     In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo.nc; we want the
     dataset to be created in the current directory only if a dataset with
     that name does not already exist:

     @code
     #include <netcdf.h>
     ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
     ...
     status = nc_create("foo.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     @endcode

     In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_large.nc. It will
     be in the 64-bit offset format.

     @code
     #include <netcdf.h>
     ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
     ...
     status = nc_create("foo_large.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_64BIT_OFFSET, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     @endcode

     In this example we create a netCDF dataset named foo_HDF5.nc. It will
     be in the HDF5 format.

     @code
     #include <netcdf.h>
     ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
     ...
     status = nc_create("foo_HDF5.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_NETCDF4, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     @endcode

     In this example we create a netCDF dataset named
     foo_HDF5_classic.nc. It will be in the HDF5 format, but will not allow
     the use of any netCDF-4 advanced features. That is, it will conform to
     the classic netCDF-3 data model.

     @code
     #include <netcdf.h>
     ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
     ...
     status = nc_create("foo_HDF5_classic.nc", NC_NOCLOBBER|NC_NETCDF4|NC_CLASSIC_MODEL, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     @endcode

     In this example we create an in-memory netCDF classic dataset named
     diskless.nc whose content will be lost when nc_close() is called.

     @code
     #include <netcdf.h>
     ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
     ...
     status = nc_create("diskless.nc", NC_DISKLESS, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     @endcode

     In this example we create a in-memory netCDF classic dataset named
     diskless.nc and specify that it should be made persistent
     in a file named diskless.nc when nc_close() is called.

     @code
     #include <netcdf.h>
     ...
     int status = NC_NOERR;
     int ncid;
     ...
     status = nc_create("diskless.nc", NC_DISKLESS|NC_PERSIST, &ncid);
     if (status != NC_NOERR) handle_error(status);
     @endcode

 *
 * <h2>Open Mode</h2>
 *
 * A zero value (or ::NC_NOWRITE) specifies the default behavior: open
 * the dataset with read-only access, buffering and caching accesses
 * for efficiency.
 *
 * Otherwise, the open mode is ::NC_WRITE, ::NC_SHARE, or
 * ::NC_WRITE|::NC_SHARE. Setting the ::NC_WRITE flag opens the
 * dataset with read-write access. ("Writing" means any kind of change
 * to the dataset, including appending or changing data, adding or
 * renaming dimensions, variables, and attributes, or deleting
 * attributes.)
 *
 * The NC_SHARE flag is only used for netCDF classic
 * files. It is appropriate when one process may be writing the
 * dataset and one or more other processes reading the dataset
 * concurrently; it means that dataset accesses are not buffered and
 * caching is limited. Since the buffering scheme is optimized for
 * sequential access, programs that do not access data sequentially
 * may see some performance improvement by setting the NC_SHARE flag.
 *
 * This procedure may also be invoked with the NC_DISKLESS flag set in
 * the omode argument if the file to be opened is a classic format
 * file.  For nc_open(), this flag applies only to files in classic
 * format.  If the file is of type NC_NETCDF4, then the NC_DISKLESS
 * flag will be ignored.
 *
 * If NC_DISKLESS is specified, then the whole file is read completely
 * into memory. In effect this creates an in-memory cache of the file.
 * If the omode flag also specifies NC_PERSIST, then the in-memory cache
 * will be re-written to the disk file when nc_close() is called.  For
 * some kinds of manipulations, having the in-memory cache can speed
 * up file processing. But in simple cases, non-cached processing may
 * actually be faster than using cached processing.  You will need to
 * experiment to determine if the in-memory caching is worthwhile for
 * your application.
 *
 * Normally, NC_DISKLESS allocates space in the heap for storing the
 * in-memory file. If, however, the ./configure flags --enable-mmap is
 * used, and the additional omode flag NC_MMAP is specified, then the
 * file will be opened using the operating system MMAP facility.  This
 * flag only applies to files in classic format. Extended format
 * (netcdf-4) files will ignore the NC_MMAP flag.
 *
 * In most cases, using MMAP provides no advantage for just
 * NC_DISKLESS. The one case where using MMAP is an advantage is when
 * a file is to be opened and only a small portion of its data is to
 * be read and/or written.  In this scenario, MMAP will cause only the
 * accessed data to be retrieved from disk. Without MMAP, NC_DISKLESS
 * will read the whole file into memory on nc_open. Thus, MMAP will
 * provide some performance improvement in this case.
 *
 * It is not necessary to pass any information about the format of the
 * file being opened. The file type will be detected automatically by
 * the netCDF library.
 *
 * If a the path is a DAP URL, then the open mode is read-only.
 * Setting NC_WRITE will be ignored.
 *
 * As of version 4.3.1.2, multiple calls to nc_open with the same
 * path will return the same ncid value.

    <h1>The chunksizehintp Parameter</h1>

    The argument referenced by bufrsizehintp controls a space versus time
    tradeoff, memory allocated in the netcdf library versus number of
    system calls.

    Because of internal requirements, the value may not be set to exactly
    the value requested. The actual value chosen is returned by reference.

    Using a NULL pointer or having the pointer point to the value
    NC_SIZEHINT_DEFAULT causes the library to choose a default.
    How the system chooses the default depends on the system. On
    many systems, the "preferred I/O block size" is available from the
    stat() system call, struct stat member st_blksize. If this is
    available it is used. Lacking that, twice the system pagesize is used.

    Lacking a call to discover the system pagesize, we just set default
    bufrsize to 8192.

    The bufrsize is a property of a given open netcdf descriptor ncid, it
    is not a persistent property of the netcdf dataset.

    For netCDF-4 files (i.e. files created with NC_NETCDF4 in the cmode in
    their call to nc_create()), it is not necessary to call nc_redef()
    unless the file was also created with NC_STRICT_NC3. For straight-up
    netCDF-4 files, nc_redef() is called automatically, as needed.

    For all netCDF-4 files, the root ncid must be used. This is the ncid
    returned by nc_open() and nc_create(), and points to the root of the
    hierarchy tree for netCDF-4 files.

/** \ingroup datasets

    The function nc_enddef() takes an open netCDF dataset out of define
    mode. The changes made to the netCDF dataset while it was in define
    mode are checked and committed to disk if no problems
    occurred. Non-record variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as
    well with nc_set_fill(). The netCDF dataset is then placed in data
    mode, so variable data can be read or written.

    It's not necessary to call nc_enddef() for netCDF-4 files. With netCDF-4
    files, nc_enddef() is called when needed by the netcdf-4 library. User
    calls to nc_enddef() for netCDF-4 files still flush the metadata to
    disk.

    This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
    more extensive discussion see File Structure and Performance.

    For netCDF-4/HDF5 format files there are some variable settings (the
    compression, endianness, fletcher32 error correction, and fill value)
    which must be set (if they are going to be set at all) between the
    nc_def_var() and the next nc_enddef(). Once the nc_enddef() is called,
    these settings can no longer be changed for a variable.

    \param ncid NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open() or
    nc_create().

    If you use a group id (in a netCDF-4/HDF5 file), the enddef
    will apply to the entire file. That means the enddef will not just end
    define mode in one group, but in the entire file.

    occurred. Non-record variables may be initialized to a "fill value" as

    so variable data can be read or written.

    This call may involve copying data under some circumstances. For a
    more extensive discussion see File Structure and Performance.

    \warning This function exposes internals of the netcdf version 1 file
    format. Users should use nc_enddef() in most circumstances. This
    function may not be available on future netcdf implementations.

    The classic netcdf file format has three sections, the "header"
    section, the data section for fixed size variables, and the data
    section for variables which have an unlimited dimension (record
    variables).

    The header begins at the beginning of the file. The index (offset) of
    the beginning of the other two sections is contained in the
    header. Typically, there is no space between the sections. This causes
    copying overhead to accrue if one wishes to change the size of the
    sections, as may happen when changing names of things, text attribute
    values, adding attributes or adding variables. Also, for buffered i/o,
    there may be advantages to aligning sections in certain ways.

    The minfree parameters allow one to control costs of future calls to
    nc_redef, nc_enddef() by requesting that minfree bytes be available at
    the end of the section.

    The align parameters allow one to set the alignment of the beginning
    of the corresponding sections. The beginning of the section is rounded
    up to an index which is a multiple of the align parameter. The flag
    value ALIGN_CHUNK tells the library to use the bufrsize (see above) as
    the align parameter. It has nothing to do with the chunking
    (multidimensional tiling) features of netCDF-4.

    The file format requires mod 4 alignment, so the align parameters are
    silently rounded up to multiples of 4. The usual call,

    \code
    nc_enddef(ncid);
    \endcode

    is equivalent to

    \code
    nc__enddef(ncid, 0, 4, 0, 4);
    \endcode

    The file format does not contain a "record size" value, this is
    calculated from the sizes of the record variables. This unfortunate
    fact prevents us from providing minfree and alignment control of the
    "records" in a netcdf file. If you add a variable which has an
    unlimited dimension, the third section will always be copied with the
    new variable added.

    \param ncid NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open() or
    nc_create().

    \param h_minfree Sets the pad at the end of the "header" section.

    \param v_align Controls the alignment of the beginning of the data
    section for fixed size variables.

    \param v_minfree Sets the pad at the end of the data section for fixed
    size variables.

    \param r_align Controls the alignment of the beginning of the data

/** \ingroup datasets
    Synchronize an open netcdf dataset to disk

    The function nc_sync() offers a way to synchronize the disk copy of a
    netCDF dataset with in-memory buffers. There are two reasons you might
    want to synchronize after writes:
    - To minimize data loss in case of abnormal termination, or
    - To make data available to other processes for reading immediately
    after it is written. But note that a process that already had the
    dataset open for reading would not see the number of records
    increase when the writing process calls nc_sync(); to accomplish this,
    the reading process must call nc_sync.

    This function is backward-compatible with previous versions of the
    netCDF library. The intent was to allow sharing of a netCDF dataset
    among multiple readers and one writer, by having the writer call
    nc_sync() after writing and the readers call nc_sync() before each
    read. For a writer, this flushes buffers to disk. For a reader, it
    makes sure that the next read will be from disk rather than from
    previously cached buffers, so that the reader will see changes made by
    the writing process (e.g., the number of records written) without
    having to close and reopen the dataset. If you are only accessing a
    small amount of data, it can be expensive in computer resources to
    always synchronize to disk after every write, since you are giving up
    the benefits of buffering.

    An easier way to accomplish sharing (and what is now recommended) is
    to have the writer and readers open the dataset with the NC_SHARE
    flag, and then it will not be necessary to call nc_sync() at
    all. However, the nc_sync() function still provides finer granularity
    than the NC_SHARE flag, if only a few netCDF accesses need to be
    synchronized among processes.

    It is important to note that changes to the ancillary data, such as
    attribute values, are not propagated automatically by use of the
    NC_SHARE flag. Use of the nc_sync() function is still required for this
    purpose.

    Sharing datasets when the writer enters define mode to change the data
    schema requires extra care. In previous releases, after the writer
    left define mode, the readers were left looking at an old copy of the
    dataset, since the changes were made to a new copy. The only way
    readers could see the changes was by closing and reopening the
    dataset. Now the changes are made in place, but readers have no
    knowledge that their internal tables are now inconsistent with the new
    dataset schema. If netCDF datasets are shared across redefinition,
    some mechanism external to the netCDF library must be provided that
    prevents access by readers during redefinition and causes the readers
    to call nc_sync before any subsequent access.

    When calling nc_sync(), the netCDF dataset must be in data mode. A
    netCDF dataset in define mode is synchronized to disk only when
    nc_enddef() is called. A process that is reading a netCDF dataset that
    another process is writing may call nc_sync to get updated with the
    changes made to the data by the writing process (e.g., the number of
    records written), without having to close and reopen the dataset.

    Data is automatically synchronized to disk when a netCDF dataset is
    closed, or whenever you leave define mode.

/** \ingroup datasets
    Change the fill-value mode to improve write performance.

    This function is intended for advanced usage, to optimize writes under
    some circumstances described below. The function nc_set_fill() sets the
    fill mode for a netCDF dataset open for writing and returns the
    current fill mode in a return parameter. The fill mode can be
    specified as either ::NC_FILL or ::NC_NOFILL. The default behavior
    corresponding to ::NC_FILL is that data is pre-filled with fill values,
    that is fill values are written when you create non-record variables
    or when you write a value beyond data that has not yet been
    written. This makes it possible to detect attempts to read data before
    it was written. For more information on the use of fill values see
    Fill Values. For information about how to define your own fill values
    see Attribute Conventions.

    The behavior corresponding to ::NC_NOFILL overrides the default behavior
    of prefilling data with fill values. This can be used to enhance
    performance, because it avoids the duplicate writes that occur when
    the netCDF library writes fill values that are later overwritten with
    data.

    A value indicating which mode the netCDF dataset was already in is
    returned. You can use this value to temporarily change the fill mode
    of an open netCDF dataset and then restore it to the previous mode.

    After you turn on ::NC_NOFILL mode for an open netCDF dataset, you must
    be certain to write valid data in all the positions that will later be
    read. Note that nofill mode is only a transient property of a netCDF
    dataset open for writing: if you close and reopen the dataset, it will
    revert to the default behavior. You can also revert to the default
    behavior by calling nc_set_fill() again to explicitly set the fill mode
    to ::NC_FILL.

    There are three situations where it is advantageous to set nofill
    mode:
    - Creating and initializing a netCDF dataset. In this case, you should
    set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef() and then write completely
    all non-record variables and the initial records of all the record
    variables you want to initialize.
    - Extending an existing record-oriented netCDF dataset. Set nofill
    mode after opening the dataset for writing, then append the
    additional records to the dataset completely, leaving no intervening
    unwritten records.
    - Adding new variables that you are going to initialize to an existing
    netCDF dataset. Set nofill mode before calling nc_enddef() then write
    all the new variables completely.

    If the netCDF dataset has an unlimited dimension and the last record
    was written while in nofill mode, then the dataset may be shorter than
    if nofill mode was not set, but this will be completely transparent if
    you access the data only through the netCDF interfaces.

    The use of this feature may not be available (or even needed) in
    future releases. Programmers are cautioned against heavy reliance upon
    this feature.

    \param ncid NetCDF ID, from a previous call to nc_open() or
    nc_create().

    \param fillmode Desired fill mode for the dataset, either ::NC_NOFILL or
    ::NC_FILL.

    \param old_modep Pointer to location for returned current fill mode of
    the dataset before this call, either ::NC_NOFILL or ::NC_FILL.

    \returns ::NC_NOERR No error.

    \returns ::NC_EBADID The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open
    netCDF dataset.

    \returns ::NC_EPERM The specified netCDF ID refers to a dataset open for
    read-only access.

    \returns ::NC_EINVAL The fill mode argument is neither ::NC_NOFILL nor
    ::NC_FILL.

    <h1>Example</h1>

    Here is an example using nc_set_fill() to set nofill mode for subsequent
    writes of a netCDF dataset named foo.nc:

    \code
    #include <netcdf.h>
    ...
    int ncid, status, old_fill_mode;
    ...
