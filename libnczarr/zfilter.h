/* The NC_VAR_INFO_T->filters field is an NClist of this struct.
Each filter can have two parts: HDF5 and Codec.
The NC_VAR_INFO_T.filters list only holds entries where both the HDF5 info
and the codec info are defined.
The NCZ_VAR_INFO_T.codecs list holds the codec info when reading a Zarr file.
Note that it is not possible to have an entry on the filters list that does not
have both HDF5 and codec. This is because nc_def_var_filter will fail if the codec
part is not available. If a codec is read from a file and there is no available
corresponding HDF5 implementation, then that codec will not appear in the filters list.
It is possible that some subset of the codecs do have a corresponding HDF5, but we
enforce the rule that no entries go into the filters list unless all are defined.
It is still desirable for a user to be able to see what filters and codecs are defined
for a variable. This is accommodated by providing two special attributes:
1, "_Filters" attribute shows the HDF5 filters defined on the variable, if any.
2, "_Codecs" attribute shows the codecs defined on the variable; for zarr, this list
   should always be defined.

For Zarr V3, we add a notion of "pseudo" filters. These are filters
that place-holders to satisfy the Zarr V3 spec, but whose action is
actually handled elsewhere in the nczarr code.
There is currently one one such pseudo filter: "bytes".
This filter is expected to be the first filter in the filter chain.
Semantically, "bytes" handles data type endianness.

Such filters do not appear in the _Codecs attribute or the _Filters attribute,
but are in the Zarr metadata.

When reading a V3 Zarr dataset, the "bytes" codec must occur first in the filter chain,
else the array is marked as unreadable.
If it the first codec, then it is parsed to find out the endianness of the array.
